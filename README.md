# Habit-tracker

This HTML code defines a form for adding and displaying TODO tasks. 
It includes form elements for task description, category, due date, and buttons for adding and deleting tasks.
The code also iterates through a list of tasks to display them, allowing users to edit and mark tasks as completed.

This project utilizes a combination of HTML, CSS, EJS (a templating engine), Express.js (a Node.js framework), and Mongoose (a MongoDB library) to create a web application for managing TODO tasks.
